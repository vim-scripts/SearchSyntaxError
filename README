" This scritp searches for the next syntax error detected by the vim highlighting
" mechanism. To search for the next syntax error, issue command
"       :ERR
" That all, folks.
"
" You can map this :ERR to your favorite key or key combination as follows:
"
"    noremap <silent><C-K><C-E>  :ERR<cr>
"
" For feedback, bugs and wishes: write to: iler.ml at gmail.com
"
" As a bonus, :ERRP searches backwards for the syntax error.
" And <Ctrl-K><Ctrl-E> is mapped to :ERR, unless somebody redefined it(
" (your vimrc or some other plugin).
